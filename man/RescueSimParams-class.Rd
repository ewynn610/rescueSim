\description{
Class for holding parameters used to simulate data using \code{rescueSim}
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{nTimepoints}}{Number of timepoints (i.e. samples) per subject.
Holds a single numeric value >0 representing the number of timepoints for
all subjects.}

\item{\code{twoGroupDesign}}{Logical value indicating whether to simulate two groups
(ex. treatment and control group).}

\item{\code{nSubjsPerGroup}}{Number of subjects per group (if using two group design)
or number of total subjects (if only single group). Holds a single
numeric value >0 indicating the number of subjects per group.}

\item{\code{maxCellsPerSamp}}{Maximum parameter used when drawing number of cells per
sample from a discrete uniform distribution. Holds a single numeric value
 >0 indicating the maximum number of cells per sample, or a vector with
 length equal to the number of conditions (group/timepoint combinations)
 with each value representing the maximum for a single condition, or a
 vector with length equal to the number of total samples with each value
 representing the maximum for a single sample.}

\item{\code{minCellsPerSamp}}{Minimum parameter used when drawing number of cells per
sample from a discrete uniform distribution. Holds a single numeric value >0
indicating the minimum number of cells per sample, or a vector with length
equal to the number of conditions (group/timepoint combinations) with each
value representing the minimum for a single condition, or a vector with
length equal to the number of total samples with each value representing
the minimum for a single sample.}

\item{\code{logLibMean}}{Mean library size (log scale) parameter. Used to draw
library size from a log-normal distribution. Holds a single value >0
indicating the mean library size on a log scale.}

\item{\code{logLibSD}}{Library size standard deviation (log scale) parameter.
Used to draw library size from a log-normal distribution. Holds a
single value >=0 indicating the standard deviation of library size on
a log scale.}

\item{\code{customLibSizes}}{An optional numeric vector of user-provided library sizes. When
provided, library sizes for simulation will be sampled (with replacement)
from this vector instead of the default log-normal distribution.
Log-transformed values are adjusted by a sample specific factor so that the
average log library size equals the overall average multiplied by the
sample-specific factor.}

\item{\code{logLibFacVar}}{Variance used for drawing sample-level multiplicative
factors which give different library size distributions for each sample.
Larger values result in larger variation in library size distributions by
sample. Holds a single value >=0 with 0 indicating no difference in the
library size distributions by sample.}

\item{\code{exprsMean}}{Gene-specific mean expression value representing the average
expression of each gene in the dataset. Holds a vector of numeric values >=0
with length equal to desired number of genes in the simulated data where each
value indicates the average expression for a single gene. If a named vector is given,
these names will be used as the gene names in the simulated \code{SingleCellExperiment}
object.}

\item{\code{dispersion}}{Gene-specific dispersion value representing the variation in
expression for each gene in the dataset. Holds a vector of numeric values >0
with length equal to desired number of genes in the simulated data where each
value indicates the dispersion for a single gene.}

\item{\code{sampleFacVarMean}}{Mean used for drawing variance (log-scale) of
sample-level multiplicative factors. Larger values result in
more between-sample variation.}

\item{\code{sampleFacVarSD}}{Standard deviation used for drawing variance (log-scale)
of sample-level multiplicative factors. Larger values result in more
variation in amount of between-sample variation across different genes.
Must be a value >=0}

\item{\code{customSampleFacVar}}{An optional numeric vector of gene-specific variance
values for sample-level multiplicative factors. Values must be >=0.
When not provided, variance values are drawn from a distribution using
\code{sampleFacVarMean} and \code{sampleFacVarSD} as parameters}

\item{\code{subjectFacVarMean}}{Mean used for drawing variance (log-scale) of
subject-level multiplicative factors. Larger values result in larger
between-subject variation.}

\item{\code{subjectFacVarSD}}{Standard deviation used for drawing variance
(log-scale) of subject-level multiplicative factors. Larger values result in
more variation in amount of between-subject variation across different genes.
Must be a value >=0.}

\item{\code{customSubjectFacVar}}{An optional numeric vector of gene-specific variance
values for subject-level multiplicative factors. Values must be >=0.
When not provided, variance values are drawn from a distribution using
\code{subjectFacVarMean} and \code{subjectFacVarSD} as parameters}

\item{\code{propDE}}{Proportion of genes differentially expressed between
timepoints/groups. Must be a numeric value between 0 and 1.}

\item{\code{deLog2FC}}{Fold change values used for differentially expressed genes.

Specifies the log2 fold changes for differentially expressed (DE) genes.
All values are interpreted as relative to a common baseline condition:
\strong{time0 and/or group0}.

Acceptable formats include:
\itemize{
  \item A single numeric value \code{>= 0}, indicating the absolute log2 fold
   change between baseline and the final condition. Log2 fold changes will be
    randomly assigned as positive or negative across DE genes.

  \item A numeric vector of possible log2 fold change values (positive and/or
   negative) from which values will be randomly drawn for DE genes.

  \item A named list of numeric vectors specifying gene-specific log2 fold
  changes for each experimental condition, relative to the baseline
  (\code{"time0"}, \code{"group0"}, or \code{"time0_group0"}
  depending on design). Each vector must have length equal to the number of
  genes. Valid names for list elements depend on the experimental design:
  \itemize{
    \item For single-group, multi-timepoint designs: \code{"time1"},
    \code{"time2"}, etc.
    \item For two-group, single-timepoint designs: \code{"group1"}
    \item For multi-timepoint, two-group designs: \code{"time1_group0"},
    \code{"time1_group1"}, etc.
  }
  The reference condition — \code{"time0"}, \code{"group0"}, or
  \code{"time0_group0"} — must \strong{not} be included in the list, as it is
   implicitly treated as having log2FC = 0.
}

When a single value or vector is provided (i.e., not a list), log2 fold
changes are applied in a structured way:
\itemize{
  \item For two-group, two-timepoint designs: group 0 shows no change over
  time, while group 1 exhibits a linear change over time from 0 to the
  specified log2FC.
  \item For designs with more than two timepoints: a linear trajectory is
  simulated, and the log2FC value represents the total change from time 0 to
  the final timepoint.
